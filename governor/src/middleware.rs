//! Additional, customizable behavior for rate limiters.
//!
//! Rate-limiting middleware follows the principle that basic
//! rate-limiting should be very cheap, and unless users desire more
//! behavior, they should not pay any extra price.
//!
//! However, if you do desire more information about what the
//! rate-limiter does (or the ability to install hooks in the
//! decision-making process), you can. The [`RateLimitingMiddleware`]
//! trait in this module allows you to customize:
//!
//! * Any additional code that gets run when a rate-limiting decision is made.
//! * What value is returned in the positive or negative case.
//!
//! Writing middleware does **not** let you override rate-limiting
//! decisions: They remain either positive (returning `Ok`) or negative
//! (returning `Err`). However, you can override the values returned
//! inside the Result for either decision.
//!
//! This crate ships two middlewares (named after their behavior in the
//! positive outcome):
//!
//! * The cheapest still-useful one, [`NoOpMiddleware`], named after its
//!   behavior in the positive case. In the positive case it returns
//!   `Ok(())`; in the negative case, `Err(`[`NotUntil`]`)`.
//!
//! * A more informative middleware, [`StateInformationMiddleware`], which
//!   returns `Ok(`[`StateSnapshot`]`)`, or
//!   `Err(`[`NotUntil`]`)`.
//!
//! ## Using a custom middleware
//!
//! Middlewares are attached to the
//! [`RateLimiter`][crate::RateLimiter] at construction time using
//! [`RateLimiter::with_middleware`][crate::RateLimiter::with_middleware]:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # fn main () {
//! # use nonzero_ext::nonzero;
//! use governor::{RateLimiter, Quota, middleware::StateInformationMiddleware};
//! let lim = RateLimiter::direct(Quota::per_hour(nonzero!(1_u32)))
//!     .with_middleware::<StateInformationMiddleware>();
//!
//! // A positive outcome with additional information:
//! assert!(
//!     lim.check()
//!         // Here we receive an Ok(StateSnapshot):
//!         .map(|outcome| assert_eq!(outcome.remaining_burst_capacity(), 0))
//!         .is_ok()
//! );
//!
//! // The negative case:
//! assert!(
//!     lim.check()
//!         // Here we receive Err(NotUntil):
//!         .map_err(|outcome| assert_eq!(outcome.quota().burst_size().get(), 1))
//!         .is_err()
//! );
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! You can define your own middleware by `impl`ing [`RateLimitingMiddleware`].
