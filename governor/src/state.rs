/// A way for rate limiters to keep state.
///
/// There are two important kinds of state stores: Direct and keyed. The direct kind have only
/// one state, and are useful for "global" rate limit enforcement (e.g. a process should never
/// do more than N tasks a day). The keyed kind allows one rate limit per key (e.g. an API
/// call budget per client API key).
///
/// A direct state store is expressed as [`StateStore::Key`] = [`NotKeyed`].
/// Keyed state stores have a
/// type parameter for the key and set their key to that.
pub trait StateStore {
    /// The type of key that the state store can represent.
    type Key;

    /// Updates a state store's rate limiting state for a given key, using the given closure.
    ///
    /// The closure parameter takes the old value (`None` if this is the first measurement) of the
    /// state store at the key's location, checks if the request an be accommodated and:
    ///
    /// * If the request is rate-limited, returns `Err(E)`.
    /// * If the request can make it through, returns `Ok(T)` (an arbitrary positive return
    ///   value) and the updated state.
    ///
    /// It is `measure_and_replace`'s job then to safely replace the value at the key - it must
    /// only update the value if the value hasn't changed. The implementations in this
    /// crate use `AtomicU64` operations for this.

    where
        F: Fn(Option<Nanos>) -> Result<(T, Nanos), E>;

    /// Same as [`measure_and_replace`](`StateStore::measure_and_replace`), but it would not replace the value at the key

///
/// This is the structure that ties together the parameters (how many cells to allow in what time
/// period) and the concrete state of rate limiting decisions. This crate ships in-memory state
/// stores, but it's possible (by implementing the [`StateStore`] trait) to make others.
